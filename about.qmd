I am a clinical pharmacologist and Associate Professor of Medicine- Infectious Diseases (MED/17) in the Department of Molecular Medicine at the University of Padua. I was born and raised in the state of Kansas in the United States of America. I earned my Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree from the University of Kansas, followed by post-graduate clinical residency training at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. I then completed an infectious diseases research fellowship at the University of Iowa with a focus on antifungal pharmacology.

I have over 25 years experience in the clinical care of immunocompromised patients and laboratory and clinical research of antimicrobial pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. My current focus is on the development of prognostic risk models and decision support tools for the diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections and multidrug resistant bacteria. I also serve as a Senior Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics Editor for the *Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy*.

Outside of work hours, my free time is spent with my wife Marta, son Marco, dog Luli â€¦and on long bike rides following the Veneto [strade sterrate](https://www.gravelinthelandofvenice.com/).
